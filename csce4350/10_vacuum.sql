/*
    "VACUUM" and defragmentation in general are not written into the SQL standard;
    however, all platforms preform this task and PostgreSQL is pretty typical.
    
    Regular vacuuming keeps the statistics up to data and optimizes the indexes.
    
    The default time is once a minute.  If it's a busy database, you'll need it.
    If not, then it doesn't matter very much.
