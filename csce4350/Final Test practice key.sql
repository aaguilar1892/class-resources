    Create a new schema named pft1 and set your searchpath..

    #1  25 points

        The objective of this section is to focus on the one-to-many
        and the many-to-many relationships.  You will need to add
        fields; however, take a mimimalist approach.  I.e.: don't
        add fields or tables unless they're required to represent
        the relationship.  Try to keep the tables as simple as possible.

        We will create a schema (or "group of logically-connected
        tables") realizing the following entities:


        Owners

        Pets  (assumably dogs)

        Tricks  (demonstrated by pets)





        Owners: An owner may be associated with zero or more pets.  (Hint: it's
        a one to many relationship.)

        The required properties of an owner are:

        fld_o_id INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY
        fld_o_name   VARCHAR(16),
        
        [Other fields may or may not be needed; if so, then add them.
         The owner name field cannot be NULL or zero length.]


        Pets: A pet has exactly one owner.  (Note: *exactly* one owner
        means no orphan records allowed.  )

        The required properties of a pet are:
        
        fld_p_id INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY
        fld_p_name   VARCHAR(16)
        
        [Other fields may or may not be needed; if so, then add them.  You do
        not need to include fields like "breed" and "color".  It is recommended
        only to add a field or fields as needed to represent the relationship.
        
        The pet name field cannot be NULL or zero length.]

        A pet may perform zero or more tricks; a trick may be performed by
        zero or more pets.  (Hint: this is a many to many relationship.)




        The required properties of a trick are:
        
        fld_t_id INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY
        fld_t_name   VARCHAR(16)
        
        -- ***
        fld_t_proficiency INTEGER DEFAULT 0
        
        [Other fields may or may not be needed; if so, then add them.
         The trick name field cannot be NULL or zero length.]

        [Other *tables* may or may not be needed; if so, then add them.]


        Grading Points
        
        All constraints must be named:
            -- Examples of named constraints:
            CREATE TABLE foo
            (
                fee VARCHAR(16),
                fie CHAR(1),
                foe INTEGER,
                fum BOOLEAN,
                --
                CONSTRAINT foo_PK PRIMARY KEY(fee),
                CONSTRAINT no_null_fie CHECK(fie IS NOT NULL),
                CONSTRAINT valid_foe CHECK(foe >= 0),
                CONSTRAINT fum_FK FOREIGN KEY(fum) REFERENCES baz(fum)
            );
            
            -- Examples of In-Line constraints that lose points:
            CREATE TABLE quux
            (
                fee VARCHAR(16) PRIMARY KEY,
                fie CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
                foe INTEGER CHECK >=0,
                fum BOOLEAN REFERENCES baz(fum)
            );
            
            Demonstrate attention to format, naming conventions and coding conventions
            used by the class this semester.
